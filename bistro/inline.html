<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that<br>
is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
        
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
